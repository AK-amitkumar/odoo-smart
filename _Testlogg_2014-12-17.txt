****Nice to fix*******
- Make "webbterms_accepted" searchable

- Add attachments from outside

SMartSe: Orders - I start a new order and click add new project, am then directed to creating a project page and loose any data submitted in the new order (it is not saved)

SMartSe: Clients - when adding a contact person the whole page of the new client is saved and I am directed to the list of clients. The button implies I will just add the contact person row and can continue to edit the client.
  is_company-checkbox for Org.client

It is possible to create a new order form, without creating an order, 
but not possible to create a new project or client form, without creating projects or clients.

Error message when deleting a client (that can not be deleted)



Disable ability to create orders on advisor-accounts


Paused: Work-flow should rather be: Select client, then select contact-person based on this client. 
Paused: Add an invoice-email-addres on client contact person that is different from the persons email-address
