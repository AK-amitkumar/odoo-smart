****Need to fix: 


Send email to Client with order info.

Email - password reminder does not send from outside. It responds with a message but, there is no email to my inbox.


Fixat (Allowed companies == my users) Change "search-formula" in advisor-account-menu-buttons: Orders = The orders that the advisor works with "my users' orders" and keep the All Orders button. 

Fixat (fel i javascriptet kvartstår) Delete buttons for Orders/list/all

Översättningar

Add document-upload to expense-module

Lasse/Anders: Apply national settings to number and date-formats.

****Nice to fix*******
- Make "webbterms_accepted" searchable

- Add attachments from outside

SMartSe: Orders - I start a new order and click add new project, am then directed to creating a project page and loose any data submitted in the new order (it is not saved)

SMartSe: Clients - when adding a contact person the whole page of the new client is saved and I am directed to the list of clients. The button implies I will just add the contact person row and can continue to edit the client.
  is_company-checkbox for Org.client

It is possible to create a new order form, without creating an order, 
but not possible to create a new project or client form, without creating projects or clients.

Error message when deleting a client (that can not be deleted)



Disable ability to create orders on advisor-accounts


Paused: Work-flow should rather be: Select client, then select contact-person based on this client. 
Paused: Add an invoice-email-addres on client contact person that is different from the persons email-address
