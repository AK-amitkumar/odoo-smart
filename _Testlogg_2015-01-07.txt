Activity onwer should be able to "give away" the admin of the Activity. 
Member of an activity can create draft -orders, and expense. 
Admin can submit to SMart


Expense-note.


Expenes: 
- The date-format needs to have a message if wrong.
- Edit expense line
- If the amount is higher than maxVAT-rate: Show warning, and accept.
- Recipient: only members of the activity.


In accounts: 
- Add a list of bank accounts, with a selected one. 
(this gives a way of detecting fraud).


Users want a time-out-in the session, to be shorter unless "a remember me"-button is clicked. or so.

****Nice to fix*******
- Make "webbterms_accepted" searchable

SMartSe: Orders - I start a new order and click add new project, am then directed to creating a project page and loose any data submitted in the new order (it is not saved)

SMartSe: Clients - when adding a contact person the whole page of the new client is saved and I am directed to the list of clients. The button implies I will just add the contact person row and can continue to edit the client.
  is_company-checkbox for Org.client

Disable ability to create orders on advisor-accounts

Paused: Work-flow should rather be: Select client, then select contact-person based on this client. 
Paused: Add an invoice-email-addres on client contact person that is different from the persons email-address
