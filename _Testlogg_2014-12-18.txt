****Need to fix: 

From Juleks Demo:

It responds with a message but, there is no email to my inbox.


Change the logic of the New Expense-Save-button to "save" + "add new expense-line"

In an expense-note. 
- Add two amounts_ VATincl and VATexcl. 
- if the amount is not a normal VAT-rate: Show warning, and accept.

Edit expense line


New module:
 Add a member of the activity

In accounts: 
- Add a list of bank accounts, with a selected one. 
(this gives a way of detecting fraud).

****Nice to fix*******
- Make "webbterms_accepted" searchable

SMartSe: Orders - I start a new order and click add new project, am then directed to creating a project page and loose any data submitted in the new order (it is not saved)

SMartSe: Clients - when adding a contact person the whole page of the new client is saved and I am directed to the list of clients. The button implies I will just add the contact person row and can continue to edit the client.
  is_company-checkbox for Org.client

Disable ability to create orders on advisor-accounts

Paused: Work-flow should rather be: Select client, then select contact-person based on this client. 
Paused: Add an invoice-email-addres on client contact person that is different from the persons email-address
